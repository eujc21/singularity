# Queries

Singularity has many types of queries enabled. Each query operator can be added used multiple times and compounded at the end when the final query is built

Example :

```js
App.Collections.Projects()
 .where('createdAt', '>=', new Date())
 .where('serviceType', '=', 'HVAC')
 .sortBy('createdAt', -1)
 .sortBy('cost', 1)
 .fetch()
 .then((results) => console.log(results))
```

Resulting query :
```
.find({
  "createdAt": {
    "$gte": new Date()
  },
  "serviceType": "HVAC"
}, {
  "sort": {
    "createdAt": -1,
    "cost": 1
  },
  "limit": 5,
  "skip": 10
})
```

***hint***
You can always view your query by running `.getQuery()` instead of `fetch()` `cursor()` or `aggregate()` to get the options for the query run `getOptions()` to view an aggregation run `getAggregation()`

####[Operators](./operators.md)
Singularity has changed the MongoDB operators to match what most developers are used to when programming.

```
 = is $eq (we cannot use $eq in minimongo so we just do { key : value })
 > is $gt
 < is $lt
 >= is $gte
 <= is $lte
 != is $ne
 in is $in
 !in is $nin
 or is $or
```

####[Where](./where.md)
Where has the capability to find by various operators.

```js
where(key, is, value)
```

Example :

```js
Collection()
 .where('createdAt', '<=', new Date())
 .cursor()
```

####[Select](./select.md)
Select has the capability to pick out fields to be returned by the database

```js
select(...keys)
```

Example :

```js
Collection()
 .select('createdAt', 'name', 'foobar')
 .where('createdAt', '<=', new Date())
 .cursor()
```

####sortBy
SortBy has the capability to sort a collection by a key either using acs or decs

```js
where(key, is, value)
```

Example :

```js
Collection()
 .where('createdAt', '<=', new Date())
 .sortBy('createdAt', -1)
 .cursor()
```
